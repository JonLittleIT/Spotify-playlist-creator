#h1 Intro
This is a command line implementation of the [The Playlist Miner from plamere](https://github.com/plamere/playlistminer).
The playlist is created by counting the amount of appearances of songs in other playlists and then selecting the most counted songs. These other playlists are searched using specified keywords in the description of you playlist

#h1 Requirements
Same requirements than [The Playlist Miner from plamere](https://github.com/plamere/playlistminer).
I'm using Python 2.7.10 haven't tried on Python 3
Spotipy MUST be installed.

#h1 Usage
#h2 My Personal Implementation
1. Create a playlist using the GUI/APP
2. Edit it's description in such way the the keywords used are comma separated values after the first appearance of ':', and a value between 0 and 1 must be provided after the second ':'(I will explain what this number is latter).
  Example: `This is an automatic playlist generated by my cool program using the following keywords bla bla bla : dance, electronic music, house, pop: 0.05`
3. Edit the amount of playlists to be searched before choosing the songs in the .py file.
  The total amount of playlists to be searched is divided by the amount of key words chosen. So if the keywords are : "rock, John Lennon" and you'v chosen to read from 100 playlists, the program will search for 50 playlists with the word "rock" and 50 with the word "John Lennon".
  Of course, the bigger the number, the longer your program should run and the more precise the result should be. Currently, set to 7000 playlists, my computer takes between 30 and 40 minutes to complete the task. Now, if your connection is not the best, longer runs will end up in Spotify server cutting your connection, so play with this number.

#h4 The "magic number"
The number between 0 and 1 after the second ':' represents the level importance the program gives to the songs's popularity; Spotify places a number between 0 and 100 that represents the popularity of the song (being 100 the most popular), based on current count of daily reproductions, etc. This number is updated every couple of days.
So my "magic number" represents how important Spotify's popularity rate is to your playlist creation. For example: if we want a playlist with old classic rock songs we would generally give a "magic number" lower than 0.3 to the playlist, as we are not interested in the current popular rock songs on the market.
Now if we want a Pop playlist, we would use values above 0.5 so as to assure that the songs are currently popular.

#h2 This steps must be done
Everything is explained in detail on [The Playlist Miner from plamere](https://github.com/plamere/playlistminer), this is a simple explanation.
Playlist id can be found in the Spotify app by clicking on Share->Spotify Uri.
A login and must be done so as to generate the permission token which will be saved locale in your machine as `.cache-username-...`.
You must first must edit `playlist_creator.py` and add your `client_id`, `client_secret` and `redirect_url`.

#h2 Run
`python playlist_creator.py username playlist:pid`

I've posted and example of a bash script that would run several playlists. Never the less, the .py code could be edited so as to receive a list of playlist uri from cmd or programmatically fetch your playlists from the server and run the program.

#h2 Currently learning
Please suggest changes and edit the code to your desire. I'm currently in the learning process and help is welcomed.
